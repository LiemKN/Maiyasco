    <li>My client is a business that is running a secondhand clothing selling business</li>
    <li>The photos used on the index.html page are from unsplash.com and adhere to their licence. All other photos are
      from the client</li>
    <li>My website has 6 pages total which I belive are meaningful.</li>
    <li>My website has a header</li>
    <li>My website has navigation links</li>
    <li>My website uses media queries to shrink a multicolumn layout to a single column layout for the product pages, to
      restructure the main page, and to create a hamburger icon for navigation</li>
    <li>Product pages folow the same style and all pages share the header and footer style put into products.css and
      shared.css</li>
    <li>My website includes images with adequate alt attributes</li>
    <li>Each page has a favicon</li>
    <li>Non-html resources are organized into css, images, and js folders. I decided to add a pages folder for the
      product pages to make it more organized while I worked</li>
    <li>My website was not built using any libraries or frameworks</li>
    <li>All pages have been validated with W3's Nu Validator without warnings or errors</li>
    <li>I believe my site's content is neatly aligned. I used centering on the main page once for design purposes. I
      think it looks better centered in that instance</li>
    <li>My website uses many different font faces to keep content looking interesting/visually appealing</li>
    <li>My website includes a form for an email in the footer of each page, but there is no action</li>
    <li>The footer has links to external sites my client uses</li>
    <li>I believe my source code is readable, uses conventional, consistent formatting, and meaningful names for classes and IDs</li>
    <li>All product pages have photo transtion animations upon hover and the navigation bar has highlighting upon hover as well all powered by CSS</li>
    <li>My website is stored at https://github.com/LiemKN/maiyasco which I believe you already have the link to</li>
    <li>All files names are lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters with underscores to separate words when necessary</li>
    <li>My website has its own domain name</li>
    <li>My website is served out over HTTPS on port 443</li>
    <li>Users who access my website over HTTP are automatically redirected to HTTPS</li>
    <li>My Git repo has a steady flow of commits over the course of the project</li>
